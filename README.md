1. As my contribution in this group project I have helped with dataset loading and checking missing values.
2. I have worked on EDA part by visualizing the target column.











# Machine Learning Models Performance

This repository contains the performance metrics of various machine learning models evaluated on a specific dataset. The table below summarizes the precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for each model.

| **Model**               | **Precision** | **Recall** | **F1-Score** | **Accuracy** |
|-------------------------|---------------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression     | 0.57          | 0.54       | 0.52         | 0.59         |
| Gradient Boosting       | 0.70          | 0.69       | 0.69         | 0.71         |
| Random Forest           | 0.70          | 0.69       | 0.69         | 0.70         |
