# EDA 
1. As my contribution in this group project I have helped with dataset loading and checking missing values.
2. I have worked on EDA part by visualizing the target column.
3. for checking balanced and imbalanced data we plot some visualization.

# Preprocessing of text Data
As part of a disaster-related tweet prediction project, I led data preprocessing by implementing comprehensive text cleaning (URL/special character removal, stopwords filtering), tokenization, and lemmatization techniques. I also developed systematic approaches for handling missing values, which collectively improved data quality and established a robust foundation for our model's performance.

# TF-IDF Vectorization & Word Embedding Techniques
TF-IDF Vectorization: Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features. This method effectively captures the importance of words in the context of the dataset, allowing for better representation of textual information in machine learning models.
Training Accuracy: 0.8108581436077058
Testing Accuracy: 0.8737098892850441

# Word Embeddings: 
Integrated word embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, to capture the contextual meaning of words. This approach enhances the model's ability to understand semantic relationships between words, improving the overall accuracy and performance of the text-based analysis.


# Machine Learning Models Performance

This repository contains the performance metrics of various machine learning models evaluated on a specific dataset. The table below summarizes the precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for each model.

| **Model**               | **Precision** | **Recall** | **F1-Score** | **Accuracy** |
|-------------------------|---------------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression     | 0.57          | 0.54       | 0.52         | 0.59         |
| Gradient Boosting       | 0.70          | 0.69       | 0.69         | 0.71         |
| Random Forest           | 0.70          | 0.69       | 0.69         | 0.70         |
